# CODSOFT-JUNE
## Projects done during summer internship.

### 1. Titanic Survival Prediction

- Created a Python-based machine learning model to forecast the survival of Titanic passengers using historical data from Kaggle. 

- Utilized data analysis and predictive modeling techniques to estimate the probability of survival for future passengers. 💡

- Examined variables like age, gender, class, and fare to uncover patterns and generate accurate predictions. 📊

- Used different Machine Learning Models and Algorithms to choose the best the model for further use. ✌️

- Acquired valuable hands-on experience in Python, Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-learn throughout the project. 🐍

### 2. Sales Prediction

- Created a Python-based machine learning model to forecast the amount of a product that customers will purchase using the dataset from Kaggle. 🚢

- Utilized data analysis and predictive modeling techniques to estimate the probability. 💡

- Examined variables like TV, Radio, Newspaper, and Sales to uncover patterns and generate accurate predictions. 📊

- Acquired valuable hands-on experience in Python, Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-learn throughout the project. 🐍
